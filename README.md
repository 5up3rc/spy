# Watcher

Watcher is cross platform, general purpose, file watcher written in Go (Golang). Watcher takes a `directory` and a `program` and runs `program` whenever a file in `directory` changes.

### Install

```
go get -v github.com/jpillora/watcher
```

:warning: `watcher` uses process groups to ensure all sub-processes have exited between restarts, so only Unix systems currently work. PR to add Windows accepted!

### Usage

```
$ watcher --help

	Usage: watcher [--dir DIR] [--delay DELAY] program ...args

	Watches for changes to all files in DIR (defaults to the current
	directory). After each change, program will be restarted.
	Restarts are debounced by DELAY (defaults to '100ms').

### Example

Go

```
$ cd $GOPATH/github.com/user/repo
$ watcher go run main.go
watcher 2015/03/02 01:40:40.248290 Watching '.../github.com/user/repo'
2015/03/02 01:40:40 listening on 8080...
watcher 2015/03/02 01:40:43.996842 Restarting...
2015/03/02 01:40:44 listening on 8080...
```

Node

```
$ watcher node server.js
```

### Todo

* Include/Exclude glob options
* Extract Unix specific code into a conditional build file
* Port Unix code to Windows
