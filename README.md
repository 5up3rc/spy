# Watcher

Watcher is a simple, general purpose, cross platform, file watcher written in Go (Golang). Watcher takes a `directory` and a `program` and runs `program` whenever a file in `directory` changes.

### Install

```
go get -v github.com/jpillora/watcher
```

*Currently, `watcher` only works on **Unix** systems as it uses process groups to ensure all sub-processes have exited between restarts. A pull request to add Windows support would be greatly appreciated!*

### Usage

```
$ watcher --help

	Usage: watcher [options] program ...args

	program (along with it's args) is initially
	run and then it is restarted with every file
	change. program will always be run from the
	current working directory.

	Options:

	--inc INCLUDE - Describes a path to files to
	watch. Use ** to describe any number of
	directories. Use * to describe any file name.
	For example, you could watch all Go source
	files with "**/*.go" or all	JavaScript source
	files in './lib/' with "lib/**/*.js".

	--exc EXCLUDE - Describes a path to files not
	to watch. Inverse of INCLUDE.

	--dir DIR - Watches for changes to all files in
	DIR (defaults to the current directory). After
	each change, program will be restarted.

	--delay DELAY - Restarts are debounced by DELAY
	(defaults to '0.5s').

	-v - Enable verbose logging
