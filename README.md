# Spy

Spy is a simple, general purpose, cross platform, file spy written in Go (Golang). Spy takes a `directory` and a `program` and runs `program` whenever a file in `directory` changes.

### Install

```
go get -v github.com/jpillora/spy
```

*Currently, `spy` does not fully support windows, as it uses process groups to ensure all sub-processes have exited between restarts. A pull request which implements the `process_win.go` file would be appreciated.*

### Usage

```
$ spy --help

	Usage: spy [options] program ...args

	program (along with it's args) is initially
	run and then it is restarted with every file
	change. program will always be run from the
	current working directory.

	Options:

	--inc INCLUDE - Describes a path to files to
	watch. Use ** to wildcard directories. Use
	* to wildcard file names. For example, you
	could watch all Go source files with "**/*.go"
	or all	JavaScript source files in './lib/'
	with "lib/**/*.js".

	--exc EXCLUDE - Describes a path to files not
	to watch. Inverse of INCLUDE.

	--dir DIR - Watches for changes to all files in
	DIR (defaults to the current directory). After
	each change, program will be restarted.

	--delay DELAY - Restarts are debounced by DELAY
	(defaults to '0.5s').

	-v - Enable verbose logging
